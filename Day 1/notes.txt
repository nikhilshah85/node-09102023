			Revolution means a very big change - drastic change - shift from 1 to other

			Reason : This is a change in the way ppl used internet those days and today
				2000-2012 and 2016-2022



			1. When did you use internet for the first time - year
				world average is 2007 - across the world
			2. Why did you use internet those days - (between 2007-2014)
				email, downloads, surfing, project work, research etc..check tickets
			3. Where did you use internet
				home/cyber case/college
			4. What was the source of internet
				broadband/lan/dongle
			5. how did you use internet ??
				desktop/laptop (screen size was almost same) - strong hardware
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Thus as a developer, web development was done accordingly
			and we had technology designed accordingly to do so - .net, java, php, iis, apache etc.



			Today (2016-2022)
			 1. Why do you use internet those days - everything
			 2. Where did you use internet - everywhere
			 3. What was the source of internet - Wifi - mobile data
			 4. how did you use internet - mobile phones, watch, refrigertor, car, etc....

			 5. Habbits of ppl have also changed
				eg. if some one send you a group pic on whats app - what do u do ?
					zoom in - zoom out
				    start a video - and when it starts - tilt the phone
				expectations : content should also tilt

		user expectations has changed as well - need faster contents, newer content, content should tilt etc...pixcels should not burst, over lap, app has to run fast
				

		expectations from clients / business owner are not more intese - because of competition 


			eg. i got uber instead of Ola
		ola lost a busineess - revene - (big thing - lost to a compitator)
		driver lost a revenue and a customer
		brand name is spoilt ( I am a customer and I am not talking good about them)

		same story with everyone - u have a choice - zomato - swiggy - app from provider
			

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			developer has to develop everything based on the above requiremebt
			.net, java, php, python were not capable 
			web services - for data exchange - not suitable for slow internet - thus REST today

			Google has been really innovative in this

			they launched google chrome with their own technology/engine/arcitecure etc..
			chrome uses = an engine - V8 engine - very fast and suitable to todays user need

			based on same technology - they gave NodeJS - faster and friendly - works for every OS
			platform independet

			NodeJS
			1. Compiler for web - Javascript and Ecma Script (Typescript)
			2. Web Server to host web applications - single thread app on OS
			3. Platform independent - free - no licence - supports multiple frameworks
							(angular/react etc..)

		a platform to create, test, deploy, run MEAN stack and MERN stack application
			M - MongoDB
			E - Express(name of a Node module)
			A - Angular
			N - NodejS


			M - MongoDB
			E - Express
			R - React 
			N - Node

	

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		1.download and install from 
			nodejs.org
		2.download and install VS Code 
		
		3. Write our first Javascript program and run it on NodeJS
			access the same on a browser
			use very first and basic nodejs module - Http

			

			Short Break : 4:35 - 4:55
