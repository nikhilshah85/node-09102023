Node Package
	this is a set of classes, methods, properties, sometimes even a variable - pre-defined
	which can be used for multiple applications

	(Package in Java - namespace/dll in .net) - Library in c++

	----------------------------------------------
	a. Global pacakges (commonly used packages like Http, express, fileIo etc)
		they come pre-installed when you install Node

		they are available in node_modules folder

	b. NodeJs is an open source - pacakages are created/developed by organizations, communities
		and deployed to NodeJS which is downloadable from anywhere

		eg. Microsoft has pacakges to connect to sql server
		   Amazon has packages to connect to AWS 
		   SAP has to connect to sap
	      
		we use npm install commands to download other packages
